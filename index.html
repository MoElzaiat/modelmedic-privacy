<h1>ModelMedic – Publisher Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Publisher:</strong> ME Solutions (Mohamed Elzaiat)<br>
<strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:mo.elzaiat@outlook.com">mo.elzaiat@outlook.com</a><br>
<strong>Effective date:</strong> 8 September 2025</p>

<h2>1) Scope</h2>
<p>This policy describes how we handle personal data in connection with the <strong>ModelMedic</strong> Revit add-in and our related support channels. Purchases through the Autodesk App Store are also subject to Autodesk’s terms; Autodesk may share purchaser details with us for entitlement and support.</p>

<h2>2) What data we collect, how we collect it, and how we use it</h2>

<h3>A. By default (offline operation)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> ModelMedic runs locally inside Autodesk Revit. It does not read, upload, or store your model content. It collects no personal data or telemetry by default.</li>
  <li><strong>How it’s collected:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
  <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Order/entitlement information (from Autodesk)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What we receive:</strong> Your name and email associated with the order, provided by Autodesk for entitlement and support.</li>
  <li><strong>How it’s collected:</strong> Provided by Autodesk when you obtain the app.</li>
  <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> To verify entitlement, assist with support, manage licensing communications, and comply with legal/accounting obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>C. Required weekly update check (and future licensing)</h3>
<div class="box">
  <p><strong>Update checks are required.</strong> ModelMedic performs a weekly online update check. If a critical update is available, the app may require you to update before further use. This mechanism also allows us to enforce licensing in the future.</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What is transmitted:</strong> the app version, the Revit major version, the edition (e.g., Revit 2025/2026), a timestamp, and a randomly generated <em>installation ID</em> (UUID) that does not contain your name or model data. Standard server access logs may include IP address and user-agent as part of normal web requests.</li>
  <li><strong>How it’s collected:</strong> The add-in sends a small request to our update/licensing endpoint weekly (or when you manually check for updates).</li>
  <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> To determine whether an update is required, to validate entitlements once licensing is introduced, and to prevent abuse. We do not use this data for analytics or advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h3>D. Support communications (if you contact us)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> Your email address and any information you choose to share (e.g., screenshots, logs that you manually provide).</li>
  <li><strong>How it’s collected:</strong> Email or other channels you initiate.</li>
  <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> To resolve your request and improve reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Sharing with third parties &amp; protection commitments</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal data. We share only when necessary and require any third party to protect data to at least the standards in this policy (confidentiality, security, limited-purpose processing, and deletion on request/termination).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autodesk (App Store):</strong> provides us purchaser name/email for entitlement and support.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft (OneDrive/SharePoint) – planned:</strong> may be used to host the update manifest and/or license entitlements. If used, only minimal metadata listed in section 2C is stored.</li>
  <li><strong>Email provider:</strong> email you send to us is processed by our email service to deliver and store your messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will keep an up-to-date list of processors upon request.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting (GitHub Pages).</strong> This policy page is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect standard server logs (including visitor IP addresses) for security and abuse prevention. See GitHub’s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Statement</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<h2>4) Data retention and deletion</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Order/entitlement records (name/email):</strong> retained <em>for as long as the license is active</em> and as needed for support and legal/accounting obligations, then securely deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Update/licensing check logs:</strong> retained up to <em>12 months</em>, then deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Support emails/materials:</strong> retained up to <em>24 months</em> from last interaction, then deleted (earlier on request where legally permitted).</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) How to revoke consent and/or request deletion</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stopping further collection:</strong> The weekly update check is required for the app to function. To stop any further collection, uninstall the add-in.</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion requests:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:mo.elzaiat@outlook.com">mo.elzaiat@outlook.com</a> with subject “Privacy – Deletion Request.” We will delete personal data we control (and instruct any processors to do the same) unless retention is required by law.</li>
  <li><strong>Access/Correction:</strong> You may email us to access or correct your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6) Your rights (applies worldwide)</h2>
<p>Regardless of where you live, you may request <strong>access</strong>, <strong>correction</strong>, or <strong>deletion</strong> of your personal data. You may also object to or restrict certain processing and withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

<h2>7) Security</h2>
<p>We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

<h2>8) International transfers</h2>
<p>If data is transferred across borders, we use appropriate safeguards required by law to protect your information.</p>

<h2>9) Children</h2>
<p>ModelMedic is professional software intended for use with Autodesk Revit and is <strong>not directed to children</strong> and not intended for individuals under 16.</p>

<h2>10) Changes</h2>
<p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the effective date above and provide notice via the App Store listing and/or in-app notice.</p>
